Attempting to beat Dr. Chris Plaue PhD's AI for hangman

The methods available in HangmanAI include
- default constructor whose responsibilities are to open up dictionary.data (which must be in the same directory as your hangman program)
- char makeGuess (String, String) where the first parameter is the word with blanks (lower case letters, blanks are -). The second parameter is a string of guessed words.
