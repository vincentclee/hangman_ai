A Better Strategy for Hangman
==========

Attempting to beat Dr. Chris Plaue PhD's AI for hangman

The methods available in HangmanAI include
- default constructor whose responsibilities are to open up dictionary.data (which must be in the same directory as your hangman program)
- char makeGuess (String, String) where the first parameter is the word with blanks (lower case letters, blanks are -). The second parameter is a string of guessed words. 

#AI Step by Step

##Validation Procedure
> accuracy = number of guesses / number of actual guesses

> MINE: 0.7792318457931986  
> PLAUE: 0.47667409819988715


I have achieved a **30.3%** increase in accuracy over Dr. Chris Plaue PhD's Algorithm.  
The Dictionary contains **172820** elements.  
Also runtime, not theoretical runtime, is a lot lower.
